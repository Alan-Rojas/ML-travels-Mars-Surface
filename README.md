# ML-travels-Mars-Surface

This project faces a Robot, with no knowledge at all, trying to get information form Mars surface: concretely about a crater. This "wanna be" smart robot percieves the world through a route evaluation: it evaluates a route, and determines if it is possible and optimal (or close to). Using several search algorithms this agent finds its way trough the crater without dying in the process. The files included are: possible considerations for the actual physical agent, route planning, the actual descent with different search algoritms and the code used.
